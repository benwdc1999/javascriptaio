# Gamelet

A starter program for writing javascript games

## Usage

1. Include gamelet.js in an HTML document containing an element with an id of "ball".

'''html

<div id="ball">@</div>
<script src="gamelet.js"/>
'''

2. The script will detect when the right or left arrow keys are pressed and will move the ball accordingly.
